As software developers, we are faced with an array of tasks and problems that require our attention and expertise daily. To address these challenges, based on my studies, I rely on a problem-solving strategy that consists of four stages.

### 1 - Analyze

The first stage involves understanding the available resources and constraints of the problem. By assessing the resources at our disposal and identifying any limitations, we can gain a clear understanding of what is required to solve the problem effectively.

### 2 - Plan

The second stage is to write a program that outlines the steps needed to solve the problem. This plan of action serves as a roadmap that guides us toward a successful resolution.

### 3 - Implement

The third stage is to execute the program to obtain the desired results. By doing so, we can confirm that our solution is indeed effective and meets the requirements of the problem.

### 4 - Evaluate

Lastly, we match the results of the program with the desired output to determine if the problem has been successfully solved. This allows us to verify that our solution is accurate and meets the expectations of the stakeholders involved.

By following this four-stage problem-solving strategy, software developers can approach problems in a structured and systematic manner, leading to more efficient and effective solutions.

This four-stage problem-solving strategy is not only effective in the context of software development but can also be applied to various real-life situations. By breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps and following a structured approach, we can approach challenges with greater confidence and achieve successful outcomes.
